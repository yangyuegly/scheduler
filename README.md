**Team Members:** Abby Goldberg, Shenandoah Duraideivamani, Rachel Fuller, Yue (Jane) Yang

**Team Strengths and Weaknesses:**

- Jane Yang

  - Strength: Back-end, database, systems
  - Weakness: front-end design

- Rachel

  - strengths: time management, sticking to a plan, algorithms, testing sufficiently, working on the weekends, waking up early to go to unpopular TA hours times, asking for help
  - weaknesses: getting stressed without a specific plan, getting overwhelmed by details, I’m confused by object oriented programming, getting too frustrated and leaving instead of continuing to work on a problem, html and css

- Shenandoah

  - Strengths: determination; time management; know when to call a break; starting projects early; I’m good at functional programming and testing.
  - Weakness: I’m a bit slow in grasping concepts. I need to take my time to understand the different requirements and concepts taught in class.I sometimes can’t focus if I’m thinking about something and I let it interrupt my schedule but I’m improving now and it’s been getting much better. In terms of code, I’m not good at front-end design.

- Abby
  - Strengths: attention to details, organization, willing to take the time to thoroughly understand topics
  - Weaknesses: easily stressed, art-related activities, speed of decision making, focus on details too much before determining the general outline

**Project Idea(s):** _Fill this in with three unique ideas! (Due by March 2)_

### Idea 1

An app to help students off meal plan with food situation.

- Problem: both students off meal plan and the environment can benefit from shared resources.
- Our app would have the following features to address the problem:
  - a platform for students to share utensils/ ingredients/condiments
  - community feature for students in different dorms
  - a more efficient meal credit sharing algorithm
  - splitting delivery fee
- Most challenging:
  - organizing different features and provide a user interface that's not clustered.

### Idea 2

### Idea 3

**Mentor TA:** _Put your mentor TA's name and email here once you're assigned one!_

## Meetings

_On your first meeting with your mentor TA, you should plan dates for at least the following meetings:_

**Specs, Mockup, and Design Meeting:** _(Schedule for on or before March 13)_

**4-Way Checkpoint:** _(Schedule for on or before April 23)_

**Adversary Checkpoint:** _(Schedule for on or before April 29 once you are assigned an adversary TA)_
